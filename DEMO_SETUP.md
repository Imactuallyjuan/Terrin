# Demo Setup Instructions

## Demo Accounts

The database has been seeded with demo data, but you need to create Firebase accounts first.

### Option 1: Create Demo Accounts (Recommended)

1. **Create Homeowner Account:**
   - Go to the app login page
   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Email: `demo@example.com`
   - Password: `demo123`
   - Name: `John Homeowner`
   - This account will see the "Kitchen Renovation" project with full data

2. **Create Professional Account:**
   - Sign out and create another account
   - Email: `contractor@example.com` 
   - Password: `contractor123`
   - Name: `Jane Professional`
   - This account will see the professional profile and conversation data

### Option 2: Use Your Current Account

You can continue with your current account (`IE5CjY6AxYZAHjfFB6OLLCnn5dF2`) and create new projects. The app works fully - you just won't see the pre-seeded demo data.

### What's in the Demo Data

- **Kitchen Renovation Project** ($50,000 budget)
- **4 Demo Messages** between homeowner and professional
- **5 Project Milestones** (1 completed, 1 in progress, 3 pending)
- **3 Project Costs** ($12,850 total logged)
- **1 AI-Generated Estimate** (detailed cost breakdown)
- **Professional Profile** (Jane's Professional Services)
- **4 Notifications** (mix of read/unread)

### Demo Features to Test

The seeded data provides a realistic testing environment to explore all features without having to create everything from scratch.

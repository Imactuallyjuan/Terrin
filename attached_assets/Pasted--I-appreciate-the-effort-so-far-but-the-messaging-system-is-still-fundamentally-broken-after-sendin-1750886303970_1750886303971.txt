 I appreciate the effort so far, but the messaging system is still fundamentally broken after sending a message. Here's what's happening right now:

üêû Current Bugs:
After sending a message:

The entire message thread disappears

A loading spinner shows indefinitely

The professional's name shows as "Professional" instead of "Valley Point Construction"

The correct messages only appear if I leave to the dashboard and come back.

‚úÖ What Needs to Be Fixed (Step-by-Step):
1. Message Cache Should Be Appended, Not Replaced
In the mutation‚Äôs onSuccess or onMutate, use this:

ts
Copy
Edit
queryClient.setQueryData(['messages', conversationId], (old: Message[] = []) => {
  const alreadyExists = old.some(msg => msg.id === newMessage.id);
  return alreadyExists ? old : [...old, newMessage];
});
‚úÖ This appends the new message
‚ùå Do NOT replace the array with just the new message

2. Avoid Immediate Query Invalidations After Sending
If you do a queryClient.invalidateQueries(['messages', conversationId]) right after setQueryData, it overwrites your optimistic update with nothing (or stale data). Either:

Delay the invalidation with setTimeout, or

Move it to onSettled to avoid overwriting the UI too fast

3. Fix Professional Name Resolution Logic
Instead of weird fallbacks like "Professional", use this approach:

ts
Copy
Edit
const participant = professionals.find(p => p.id === conversation.participantId);
const displayName = participant?.companyName ?? 'Unknown Professional';
And make sure professionals is fetched and cached correctly.

4. Loading Spinner Should Only Show If messages === undefined
Right now, you're using some logic like this:

tsx
Copy
Edit
if (isLoading || isFetching) return <Spinner />;
Instead, use:

tsx
Copy
Edit
if (!messages) return <Spinner />;
This avoids the flicker and stuck spinner when there's existing data in cache.

5. Persist Company Name (Valley Point Construction)
You're currently showing ‚ÄúProfessional‚Äù because:

You‚Äôre either dropping the companyName from the cache

Or the lookup uses a stale/undefined professionals list

Fix by ensuring the professionals query runs once, and is cached by user ID for lookup.

6. Use Stable Keys for Message Components
Ensure you don‚Äôt do this (which resets state on rerenders):

tsx
Copy
Edit
key={Math.random()}
Instead:

tsx
Copy
Edit
key={message.id}
‚úÖ Bonus: Visual Debug Instructions
Add this to your console logging:

ts
Copy
Edit
console.log("Cached messages:", queryClient.getQueryData(['messages', conversationId]));
Add fallback to show error if no messages load after 3s.

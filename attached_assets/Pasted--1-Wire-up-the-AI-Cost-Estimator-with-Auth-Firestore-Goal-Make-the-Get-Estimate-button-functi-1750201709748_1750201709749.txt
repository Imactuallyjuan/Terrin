 1Ô∏è‚É£ Wire up the AI Cost Estimator (with Auth & Firestore)
Goal: Make the Get Estimate button functional and tied to signed-in users.

üìã How it should work:
When the user clicks Get Estimate:

Open a form with:

Project description

Location

Square footage

Optional budget or project type (if helpful)

When submitted:

Send a POST request to /api/estimate

Call OpenAI GPT-4o with the following sample prompt:

diff
Copy
Edit
"You are a professional construction estimator. 
Please estimate the total cost for a project with the following details:
- Description: {description}
- Location: {location}
- Square Footage: {sqft}
Provide a detailed breakdown including:
- Labor costs
- Materials costs
- Permits or fees if applicable
- Contingency amount
Also, include an estimated timeline in weeks."
Parse GPT‚Äôs response and display it nicely in the UI.

Save the estimate in Firestore under an estimates collection:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  userId: "...",
  inputData: {...},
  result: {...},
  createdAt: timestamp
}
Show Recent Estimates on the dashboard for each signed-in user.

‚úÖ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Contractor Matching (Dynamic)
Goal: Make the Browse Contractors button functional with real, dynamic data.

üìã How it should work:
Open a Contractors page.

Query Firestore for all users with:

role === "contractor" or role === "both"

verified === true (optional, if we use a verified flag)

For each contractor:

Show:

Name

Specialty

Location

Rating (placeholder OK for now)

Profile photo loaded from Firebase Storage (use the profilePhotoUrl field if we save it)

Include a Contact or Request Quote button (can be placeholder for now).

‚úÖ 3Ô∏è‚É£ General
Make sure only signed-in users can access these features.

Tie all saved data to the userId from Firebase Auth.

Keep the code modular for adding more features later.

‚úÖ All Firebase, Firestore, Storage, and OpenAI secrets are ready in Replit Secrets.

Let me know if you need the actual GPT prompt or want example JSON for Firestore documents ‚Äî thanks so much!
